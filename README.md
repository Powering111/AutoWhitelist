It is really long time ago when I made it, so I don't know how to use this.
It is a PaperMC(Minecraft server) plugin.

Open this folder in IntelliJ IDEA.
Use Gradle build tools, there is a CopyToServer task so you can use it when you want to. (put your server path in serverDir of gradle.properties file)
